                The page-building phase:

                    Before a web application can be interacted with or even displayed, the page must be built from the information in the repsonse received from the server (usually HTML, CSS and JavaScript code).
                    The goal of this page-building phase is done in two steps:
                    
                    1] Parsing the HTML and building the Document Object Model(DOM) (browser processing HTML)
                    2] Executing the JavaScript code (happens in script tags)

                    Parsing the HTML and building the DOM

                    As the page loads the browser creates the DOM object with the given HTML until the first script tag is reached.



                    IMPORTANT NOTE:

                    It's important to emphasize that HTML and DOM are closely linked. With the DOM being created by the HTML.
                    HTML is the blueprint the browser follows when constructing the iniital DOM.
                    The browser can fix problems that it finds with this blueprint in order to create a valid DOM.

                    The browser can silently fix by constructing correct HTML.


                Executing JavaScript Code:

                    All JavaScript code contained in the script element is executed by the browser's JavaScript engine. SpiderMonkey, V8, Chakra.

                    Because the primary purpose of JavaScript code is to provide dytnamicity to the page, the browser provides an API through a global object that can be used by the JavaScript engine to interact with it.


                    Concepts:

                    Global objects in JavaScript (browser context)

                    Window Object:
                    
                    The primary global object that the browser exposes to the JavaScript engine is the window object, which represents the window in which a page is contained.
                    The window object is the global object which all other global objects, global variables (even user-defined ones), and browser APIs are accessible.

                    Document Object:
                    One of the most important properties of the global window object is document, which represents the DOM of the current page.
                    By using this object, the JavaScript code can alter the DOM of the page to any degree, by modifying or removing existing elements, and even creating inserting new ones.

                    // You can find some Web Api stuff at mozilla website (google search web api mozilla)

                    Global Code vs Function Code:

                    Global code is executed automatically by the JavaScript engine in a straight forward fashion, line by line as it's encountered.
                    
                    function addMessage() {


                    }

                    var first = document.getElementById();


                    On the other hand, function code, in order to be executed, has to be called by something else: either by global code
                    by some other function ir by the browser.

                
                Executing JavaScript cod ein the page-building phase:

                    When the browser reaches the script node in the page-building phase, it pauses the DOM construction based on HTML code
                    and starts executing JavaScript code instead.

                    This means executing the global JavaScript code contained in the script element (and functions called by the global code are also executed).

                    People tend to put the script tags on the bottom of the page because you don't have to worry about elements not being rendered yet.

                    Global state of JavaScript application persist in the meantime. All user-defined global variables created during the execution of JavaScript
                    runtime starts executing the contained JavaScript code in one script element are normally accessible to JavaScript code in other script elements.

                    This happens because the global window object, which stores all global JavaScript variable, is alive and accessible during the entire lifecycle of the page.
